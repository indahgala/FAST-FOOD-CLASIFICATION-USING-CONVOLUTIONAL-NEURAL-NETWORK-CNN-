# FAST-FOOD-CLASIFICATION-USING-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORK-CNN-

In this project, a classification task is carried out for three categories of fast food: burger, donut, and pizza. A deep learning technique based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is employed to recognize and classify food images into these categories using a prepared image dataset. The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle at the following link:
